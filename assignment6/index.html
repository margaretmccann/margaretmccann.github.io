          <h1>Police Stops in Austin, Texas</h1>

          <p>While Austin, Texas is a generally liberally-leaning city, their police forces are certainly not exempt from demonstrating the profiling bias that, unfortunately, many United States police officers enact. In recent years, there has been a large movement for awareness of police bias and the systematic racism of the United States police system. This graph shows the stops made for traffic violations in Austin, Texas in cases where the officer was aware of the race of the driver before making the decision to pull the driver over. As one can see, the amount of stops for Black and Hispanic citizens was much higher than those of any other race. This speaks to the inherently wrong and unjust fact that some police officers are more likely to pull over individuals of these races than others, perpetuating a system of racism and injustices in the U.S.</p>
