	<h1>The Pandemic Generation Goes to College. It Has Not Been Easy.</h1>

	<h2>Students missed a lot of high school instruction. Now many are behind, especially in math, and getting that degree could be harder.</h2>

<p>Jazeba Ahmad was a junior in high school when Covid-19 hit and her math education faltered. Ms. Ahmad was enrolled in an international baccalaureate math class intended to provide a strong foundation in areas like algebra, geometry, statistics and calculus.</p>

<p>But her high school in Columbus, Ohio, made a rocky transition to remote learning, she said, and soon, math classes passed with little to show for them. By her first year at Columbus State Community College, Ms. Ahmad, 19, found herself floundering in something that should have been mastered — algebra.</p>

<blockquote>“I missed out a lot in those two years,” Ms. Ahmad said. “If I had learned those skills in high school, I feel like I would have been better equipped to do well in that class.</blockquote>

<p>”Colleges are now educating their first waves of students who experienced pandemic learning loss in high school. What they are seeing is sobering, especially because the latest dismal results <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/24/us/math-reading-scores-pandemic.html"> latest dismal results</a>from the national exam of fourth and eighth graders suggest that they could face year after year of incoming students struggling to catch up. In almost all states, there were significant declines in eighth-grade math, and most states also showed a dip in reading for fourth and eighth graders.</p>

<p>In interviews across the country, undergraduates discussed how their disjointed high school experiences have trailed them in their first years of college; some professors talked about how grades are down, as well as standards. Many students are tentative and anxious.</p>

<p>For many low-income students and students of color, who have historically faced bigger obstacles to earning a degree, classes seem to be that much harder and graduating that much tougher.</p>

<p>As it is, in many states, high school graduation rates fell for the class of 2021 <a href="https://https://www.chalkbeat.org/2022/1/24/22895461/2021-graduation-rates-decrease-pandemic"> graduation rates fell for the class of 2021 </a>. And undergraduate enrollment has declined 4.2 percent since 2020, according to preliminary data published recently by the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center.</p>

<p>Community colleges, facing precipitous drops <a href="https://https://https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/us/politics/covid-19-colleges.html"> precipitous drops </a>. among Black and Hispanic students, have struggled over the past two years to bring students back <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/us/covid-poor-college-students.html"> struggled over the past two years to bring students back </a> to the classroom.</p>

<p>The swirl of issues “all demonstrate that we’ve got a crisis,” said Stanley Litow, a visiting professor of public policy at Duke University and a former deputy chancellor of the New York City public schools.</p>

<p>It’s especially bad, he said, for low-income students and students of color. “The population that we’re most interested in doing the most for seems to be moving in the wrong direction,” he said.</p>

<p>Benedict College, a historically Black college in Columbia, S.C., is facing that reality. First-year enrollment there, which typically hovers around 700 students, was halved in the fall of 2020 and rebounded to just under 600 last fall, said the college president, Roslyn Clark Artis. But this term, administrators were stunned to see an enrollment of just 378, which Dr. Artis attributed to students’ concerns about the economy.</p>

<p>Most students were high school sophomores when Covid hit, and they arrived with lower ACT scores than in previous years. The college has seen “significant remediation needs” in math, Dr. Artis said.</p>

<blockquote>“We are now two and a half weeks past midterm, and our grades are telling the tale: students are struggling in math,” she said.</blockquote>

<p>In math departments across the country, professors and administrators say more students need more support. Professors talked of whittling their syllabuses and lowering their expectations.</p>
